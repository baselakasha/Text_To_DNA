Encode your name to DNA Code

DNA is translated into protein by decoding it in sets of three bases (3 bases = codon). Each codon encodes one amino acid in the proteine.


Our Alphabet |Amino Acid Name|Simplified Codon
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
A|Alanine|GCT
B| |GCA (Alanine)
C|Cysteine|TGC
D|Aspartic acid|GAT
E|Glutamic acid|GAG
F|Phenylalanine|TTT
G|Glycine|GGG
H|Histidine|CAT
I|Isoleucine|ATA
J| |ATC (Isoleucine)
K|Lysine|AAG
L|Leucine|CTC
M|Methionine|ATG
N|Asparagine|GAC
O| |GAT (Asparagine)
P|Proline|CCC
Q|Glutamine|GAG
R|Arginine|CGT
S|Serine|TCA
T|Threonine|ACT
U| |ACG (Threonine)
V|Valine|GTC
W|Tryptophan|TGG
X| |GTA (Valine)
Y|Tyrosine|TAC
Z| |TAT (Tyrosine)

(There are 20 amino acids in proteins, each one represented by a different letter. We've cheated a bit for B, J, O, U, X and Z as these don't have corresponding amino acids in nature.)
